### What is PSyKI?

PSyKI (<u>**P**</u>latform for <u>**Sy**</u>mbolic <u>**K**</u>nowledge <u>**I**</u>njection) is a python library for symbolic knowledge injection (**SKI**).
SKI is a particular subclass of neuro-symbolic (**NeSy**) integration techniques.
PSyKI offers SKI algorithms (a.k.a. **injectors**) along with quality of service metrics (**QoS**).

You can have a look at the original paper of this technology [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15565-9_6).
