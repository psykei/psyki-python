## KBANN: Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Network

KBANN is one of the first work that allow the injection of symbolic rules into a neural network.
Back in 1994, G. G. Towell introduced the concept of KBANN in this famous [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004370294901058).
In his work, he proposed an algorithm to build a NN from propositional logic rules.

### About the rules

The supported rules of Towell's algorithm are quite limited.
Rules must be propositional logic rules and the handles type of data is categoric data.
