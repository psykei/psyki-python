## Intro

PSyKI (Platform for Symbolic Knowledge Injection) is a python library for **symbolic knowledge injection** (SKI).
In the literature, SKI may also be referred as **neuro-symbolic integration**.
PSyKI offers SKI algorithms (**injectors**) along with quality of service metrics (QoS) and other utility functionalities.
Finally, the library is open to extendability.

### More in detail

An `Injector` is a SKI algorithm that may -- or may not -- take a sub-symbolic predictor in conjunction with prior symbolic knowledge to create a new predictor through the `inject` method.
We refer to the new predictor as **educated**, while predictors that are not affected by symbolic knowledge are called **uneducated**.

Knowledge can be represented in many ways.
The most common is the representation via logic formulae.
PSyKI integrates [`2ppy`](https://github.com/tuProlog/2ppy), a python porting of [`2p-kt`](https://github.com/tuProlog/2p-kt) (a multi-paradigm logic programming framework).
Thanks to this integration, PSyKI supports logic formulae written with the formalism of Prolog.
Therefore, all subsets of the Prolog language (including Prolog itself) are potentially supported (e.g., propositional logic, Datalog, etc.).
It is worth noting that each injector may have its own requirements on the knowledge representation.

List of available injectors:

 - [`KBANN`](http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1990/aaai90-129.php), one of the first injector introduced in literature;
 - [`KILL`](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3261/paper5.pdf), constrains a NN by altering its predictions using the knowledge;
 - [`KINS`](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3204/paper_25.pdf), structure the knowledge adding ad-hoc layers into a NN.

The core abstractions of PSyKI are the following:

 - `Injector`: a SKI algorithm;
 - `Theory`: symbolic knowledge plus additional information about the domain;
 - `Fuzzifier`: entity that transforms (fuzzify) symbolic knowledge into a sub-symbolic data structure.

The class `Theory` is built upon the symbolic knowledge and the metadata of the dataset (extracted by a Pandas DataFrame).
The knowledge can be generated by an adapter that parses the Prolog theory (e.g., a `.pl` file, a string) and generates a list of `Formula` objects.
Each `Injector` has one `Fuzzifier`.
The `Fuzzifier` is used to transform the `Theory` into a sub-symbolic data structure (e.g., ad-hoc layers of a NN).
Different fuzzifiers encode the knowledge in different ways.

To avoid confusion, we use the following terminology:

 - **rule** is a single logic clause;
 - **knowledge** is the set of rules;
 - **theory** is the knowledge plus metadata.

### Hello world

The following example shows how to use PSyKI to inject knowledge into a NN.

```python
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from psyki.logic import Theory
from psyki.ski import Injector


def create_uneducated_predictor() -> Model:
...

dataset = pd.read_csv("path_to_dataset.csv")  # load dataset
knowledge_file = "path_to_knowledge_file.pl"  # load knowledge
theory = Theory(knowledge_file, dataset)      # create a theory
uneducated = create_uneducated_predictor()    # create a NN
injector = Injector.kins(uneducated)          # create an injector
educated = injector.inject(theory)            # inject knowledge into the NN

# From now on you can use the educated predictor as you would use the uneducated one
```

## Users

PSyKI is deployed as a library on Pypi, and it can therefore be installed as Python pachage by running:
```text
pip install psyki
```
